Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization. Additionally, a machine learning model was developed using Python to predict customer churn based on service usage and demographics.

Key Features:
Cleaned and transformed a dataset of 7,000+ customer records using SQL.
Created analytical views (Churn_Data_vw & Join_Data_vw) to segment churned, stayed, and newly joined customers.

Developed Power BI dashboards to track:
Total revenue: $16.98 million
Churn rate: 26.5%
Churn breakdown by state, contract, and category

Built and evaluated a Random Forest model with:
Accuracy: 83.4%
AUC Score: 0.89
Top predictors: Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges
